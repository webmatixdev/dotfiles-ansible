# AppCleaner

This role installs AppCleaner, a small application for macOS that allows you to thoroughly uninstall unwanted apps.

## What it does

AppCleaner provides:
- Complete app uninstallation by finding and deleting all associated files
- Detection of leftover files, folders, and preferences when removing apps
- Simple drag-and-drop interface for easy app removal

This is particularly useful for completely removing applications from macOS, ensuring no leftover files consume disk space or clutter the system.

## Configuration

AppCleaner works out of the box without additional configuration. Simply drag applications to AppCleaner to see all associated files before deletion.
