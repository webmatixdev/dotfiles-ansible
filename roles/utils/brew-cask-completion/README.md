# Brew Cask Completion

This role installs brew-cask-completion, which provides bash and zsh tab completion for Homebrew Cask commands.

## What it does

Brew-cask-completion adds intelligent tab completion for:
- Cask names when using `brew install --cask <TAB>`
- Cask commands and options
- Available cask versions and variants

This makes working with Homebrew Casks much more efficient by providing autocompletion for cask names and commands in your shell.

## Requirements

- Bash or Zsh shell

## Dependencies

- Homebrew

## Configuration

No additional configuration is required. The completion scripts are automatically loaded by your shell after installation.
