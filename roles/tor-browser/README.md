# Tor Browser

This role installs Tor Browser, a web browser that routes internet traffic through the Tor network to provide anonymity and privacy protection by encrypting and bouncing communications through multiple relay servers.

## What it does

Tor Browser provides:
- Anonymous web browsing through the Tor network
- Traffic encryption and routing through multiple relay servers
- Protection against tracking, surveillance, and censorship
- Built-in privacy features and security hardening
- Access to .onion hidden services
- Circumvention of internet censorship and geo-blocking
- No logging or tracking of user activity
- Automatic deletion of cookies and browsing history on exit

This is particularly useful for users who need enhanced privacy protection, journalists, activists, or anyone in regions with internet censorship.

## Requirements

- macOS with Homebrew installed

## Dependencies

- Homebrew

## Configuration

Tor Browser works out of the box with secure defaults optimized for anonymity. Users can configure security levels, proxy settings, and other privacy options through the browser's preferences, but should avoid modifications that could compromise anonymity.
