# Kotlin

This role installs Kotlin, a modern programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine and is fully interoperable with Java.

## What it does

Kotlin provides:
- Modern programming language with concise syntax
- 100% interoperability with Java code and libraries
- Null safety and type inference features
- Coroutines for asynchronous programming
- Multi-platform development capabilities
- Android development support
- Server-side development with frameworks like Spring
- Compiler and runtime tools

This is essential for Kotlin development, Android app development, and modern JVM-based applications.

## Requirements

- macOS with Homebrew installed
- JDK (should be installed via the jdk role)

## Dependencies

- Homebrew
- Java Development Kit

## Configuration

Kotlin works out of the box after installation when JDK is available. Can be used with various IDEs and build tools like Gradle or Maven.
