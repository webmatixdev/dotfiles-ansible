# LocationSimulator

This role installs LocationSimulator, a macOS application that allows you to spoof your location for iOS apps when testing location-based features.

## What it does

LocationSimulator provides:
- GPS location spoofing for iOS devices and simulators
- Easy-to-use map interface for selecting mock locations
- Support for simulating movement along predefined routes
- Integration with Xcode iOS Simulator
- Real device support via USB connection
- Custom location bookmarks and favorites
- GPX file import for complex route simulation

This is particularly useful for iOS developers testing location-based features without physically traveling to different locations.

## Requirements

- macOS with Homebrew installed
- Xcode (for iOS development)

## Dependencies

- Homebrew
- Xcode and iOS development tools

## Configuration

LocationSimulator works out of the box without additional configuration. Users can create location bookmarks and configure device connections through the GUI interface.
