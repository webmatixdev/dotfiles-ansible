# Postman

This role installs Postman, a collaboration platform for API development that provides tools for building, testing, documenting, and sharing APIs.

## What it does

Postman provides:
- API request building and testing with various HTTP methods
- Collection organization for grouping related API requests
- Environment variables and dynamic request configuration
- Automated testing with pre-request and test scripts
- API documentation generation and sharing
- Team collaboration features for API development workflows
- Mock server creation for API prototyping

This is particularly useful for developers working with APIs, whether building, testing, or consuming web services.

The application requires account authentication for full functionality and cloud synchronization.
